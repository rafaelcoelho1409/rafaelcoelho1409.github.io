Pentesting Automation is a complex pentesting automation which scans more than 20 types of web vulnerabilities in an automated way, saving time from manual work, allowing to focus on tasks which manual and careful analysis is necessary.
<br><br>
This automation was built with KALI Linux VM, and several Go, Bash and Python tools.
